# block-shuffle

Block Shuffle is a Minecraft minigame that supports 2+ players on a newly generated world. Simply place the datapack download into your datapacks folder in your world, and run `/reload`.

To start a game, run `/function sh:start`.

If you need to manually stop the game, run `/function sh:reset`.

Though every world supports any amount of games, it is recommended you make a new world each time you play.
